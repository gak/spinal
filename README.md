# Spinal

Spinal is a [Spine](http://en.esotericsoftware.com/spine-in-depth) crate for Rust.
It is also a [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/) plugin.

## Clean-room implementation

Spinal is a ["Clean-room design"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_room_design).
It does not copy any of the official runtimes (and derivatives). I have not looked at the sources.
Everything has been written based on documentation and trial and error with the Spine editor.

This laborious effort was done to use a permissive license that aligns with the Rust community.

See my [thread on the matter](http://en.esotericsoftware.com/forum/Licence-for-a-new-runtime-written-from-scratch-17841)
and the [Spine Runtimes License Agreement](http://esotericsoftware.com/spine-runtimes-license) that would have been the
alternative.
